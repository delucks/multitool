# multitool

This is a project composed of many small tools executed under a single binary, like `busybox`. I'm creating it with the intention of implementing more command-line utilities in golang and moving some of my complex shell scripts into Go with more testing.

It's based on the [leatherman](https://github.com/frioux/leatherman) project by fREW- thanks for the inspiration!

# TODO

- yamltojson
- jsontoyaml

## From dotfiles
- backlight
- fileset ("settool")
x log()
- hex() and int()
- Emoji generator script (characters with human names)

## From scripts
- colors.sh
- digdug.sh
  May as well make a generic "make me some ascii art"
- ObliqueStrategies.sh
  Could we have a script that generally caches a file locally and returns items from that file? it'd just need a url, 
- x86.py
- Imgur down/uploader

## Maybe
- iploc()
- histogram()
- lenny


Also can I kill the delucks/scripts repo? Things I still use:
- ObliqueStrategies.sh
x figletsample.sh
- parse-last.py
- fetch_beets_album.py
Occasionally:
- vc-check.sh
- colors.sh
