# multitool

This is a project composed of many small tools executed under a single binary, like `busybox`. I'm creating it with the intention of implementing more command-line utilities in golang and moving some of my complex shell scripts into Go with more testing.

It's based on the [leatherman](https://github.com/frioux/leatherman) project by fREW- thanks for the inspiration!
