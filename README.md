# multitool

This is a project composed of many small tools executed under a single binary, like `busybox`. I'm creating it with the intention of implementing more command-line utilities in golang and moving some of my complex shell scripts into Go with more testing.

It's based on the [leatherman](https://github.com/frioux/leatherman) project by fREW- thanks for the inspiration!

# TODO

- yamltojson
- jsontoyaml

## From dotfiles
- backlight
- fileset ("settool")

## From scripts
- digdug.sh
  May as well make a generic "make me some ascii art"
- ObliqueStrategies.sh
  Could we have a script that generally caches a file locally and returns items from that file? it'd just need a url, 
- x86.py
- Imgur down/uploader

## Maybe
- iploc()
- histogram()
- lenny
